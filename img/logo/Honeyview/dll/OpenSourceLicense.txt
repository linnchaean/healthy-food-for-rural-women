	------------

	- libbpg and bpgenc are released under the LGPL license (the FFmpeg
	  part is under the LGPL, the BPG specific part is released under the
	  BSD license).

	- bpgenc is released under the BSD license (it includes the JCTVC code
	  which is released under the BSD license. The BPG specific part is
	  released under the BSD license).

	- BPG relies on the HEVC compression technology which may be protected
	  by patents in some countries. Most devices already include or will
	  include hardware HEVC support, so we suggest to use it if patents
	  are an issue.
